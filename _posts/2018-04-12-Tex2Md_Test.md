Algorithm in LaTeX
==================

Sort the input set $S_i$ Binary Search for $x$ in $S_i$

\FORALL{$I$ in $S_i$}
find $x$ in $S_i$ such that $x$ = $i$ $x$ was less than the minimum
threshold

Introduction
============

As shown in
Algorithm [\[algo:stupid\]](#algo:stupid){reference-type="ref"
reference="algo:stupid"} it is blablah



```pseudo
    GenerateLTA(HEAD,L,N)
        INPUT: HEAD(the head of linklist), L(layer), N(number of nodes)
        OUTPUT: The LinkList which represents the structure of LTA
        Initialise(HEAD); (Add N emputy nodes in linklist)
        i = 1;
        while i <= L:
             add 4 bonds of each node in layer i;
            complete the loop configuration of each node in layer i;
            add 4 bond labels of each node in layer i;
            if i > 2 :
                close the 6-numbered ring of each node in layer i-2;
            if i > 3 :
                close the 8-numbered ring of each node in layer i-3;
            compute the number of nodes in layer i+1;
            exchange nodes deleted in ring closing with nodes which do not belong to layer i+1;
            i=i+1;
        return HEAD;
